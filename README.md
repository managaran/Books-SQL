# Books-SQL

Learning Objectives:

Students will create a database using a many-to-many relationship.
Students will retrieve data from related tables using join statements.
Students will use SQL queries to insert and update many-to-many relationships in a join table.

In the previous chapter, you created the books_schema. Now, you'll get the chance to forward engineer this schema, and use queries to manipulate the database. Imagine you're in charge of maintaining a database of users and books for an online book retailer. In this role, you need to manage the data that is displayed, including the books each user has favorited, the all the users that have favorited a particular book.




If you get stuck on retrieving, changing, or deleting users, books, and favorites, be sure to apply the 20 minute rule! Try re-reading the previous modules and doing research on your own, then reaching out to your peers, and finally setting up some time with a Coding Dojo staff member so that you talk through the challenge you're facing.

Forward engineer the books_schema from the previous chapter

Create a .txt file where you'll save each of your queries from below

Query: Create 5 different users: Jane Amsden, Emily Dixon, Theodore Dostoevsky, William Shapiro, Lao Xiu

Query: Create 5 books with the following names: C Sharp, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby

Query: Change the name of the C Sharp book to C#

Query: Change the first name of the 4th user to Bill

Query: Have the first user favorite the first 2 books

Query: Have the second user favorite the first 3 books

Query: Have the third user favorite the first 4 books

Query: Have the fourth user favorite all the books

Query: Retrieve all the users who favorited the 3rd book

Query: Remove the first user of the 3rd book's favorites

Query: Have the 5th user favorite the 2nd book

Find all the books that the 3rd user favorited

Query: Find all the users that favorited to the 5th book

Submit your .txt file that contains all the queries you ran in the workbench
